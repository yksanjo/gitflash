Ever feel lost navigating between 10+ projects? I built this to solve that problem.

Features:
⚡ Instant project switching with `p <project>`
🔍 Fuzzy search - type partial names!
📊 Git status across all repos with one command
🔄 Pull all repos at once

If you're a developer juggling multiple projects like me, this saves so much time.

🎯 GitFlash - Blazing fast CLI project navigator

I built this to solve my own problem - I have 13 projects scattered across my workspace and constantly forgot where they were.

Commands:
- `p <project>` - Jump to any project instantly
- `p` - Fuzzy picker if you can't remember the name
- `projects` - List all with git status
- `gstatus` - Check all repos at once
- `gpull` - Pull everything

Works in Ghostty, iTerm2, any terminal with zsh + fzf.

Would love feedback from fellow vibe coders! 🚀

[Phone showing terminal]

POV: You have 13 projects and need to switch between them

*shows long cd path*

Instead... just type "p" and the project name!

p apihub ⚡
p strix ⚡  
p devkb ⚡

Boom. You're in.

This changed my workflow forever #coding #developer #tools

🎯 GitFlash - My new CLI side project

Typing cd ~/projects/xxx/xxx every time is so 2025

Now I just type:
p projectname

And I'm there. Fuzzy search works too!

13 projects in my workspace, all accessible in 2 keystrokes ✨
